abstract: Civic organizations, ranging from interest groups to voluntary associations, constantly influence policy formation in representative democracies. This work presents a local case study that examines the relationship between voluntary associations and local political institutions in a village with almost two thousand residents. Traditionally, sociologists approaches focus on   individual characteristics such as age, gender, or socio-professional statues. Here, we analyse social interactions between members of organizations modeled through a hypergraph. Specifically, we model interactions as hyperedges that correspond to activities proposed by organizations and involve the individuals who participate in those activities. Our analysis reveals a community-based structure, in which members of similar type  of organization tend to interact more frequently. To quantify 'political participation', we introduce an interactional-based measure that extends the degree centrality. We also introduce the 'diversity coefficient' as an extension of the degree centrality to capture individual's ability to participate in activities composed of members from different communities. Among other centrality measures, we find that the diversity coefficient is the most significant factor in explaining political participation among members of associations.
