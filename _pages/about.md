I am a PhD student at [CES](https://centredeconomiesorbonne.cnrs.fr/) since 2021, under the supervision of [Antoine Mandel](https://sites.google.com/site/antoinedavidmandel/). I obtained a master's degree in physics complex systems at [Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

My current research focuses on both studying and modeling higher-order interactions in social networks.
